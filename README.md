# 🧬 Bioinformatics Fundamentals

This repository contains my introductory exercises and projects in bioinformatics.  
The goal is to build a solid foundation in biological sequence analysis, practice Python programming, and create a portfolio for future opportunities in bioinformatics, biotechnology, and computational biology.

Here I will upload simple and well-documented scripts related to:
- GC content calculation  
- DNA to protein translation  
- Motif searching  
- ORF detection  
- FASTA file parsing  
- Basic sequence manipulation  
- Introductory bioinformatics utilities

## 📁 Repository Structure


- `scripts/` — Python scripts for basic bioinformatics tasks  
- `data/` — Example FASTA files or small test datasets  
- `README.md` — Project documentation  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies

## 🎯 Project Purpose
To practice core bioinformatics concepts and build a beginner-friendly portfolio that demonstrates essential skills in computational biology.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
